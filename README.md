A simple drag and drop experiment made by me ðŸ‘€

## Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
This project uses API from [DoAnAndroid](https://github.com/GS-755/AndroidWebService).

Please run npm install with NodeJS 12.22.12 or higher to install dependencies 

```shell
npm install package.json
```

## Environment variables

You can use my .env preset to fetch the sample: 

```text
REACT_APP_API_URL=http://doanandroid.somee.com/api 
REACT_APP_IMG_URL=http://doanandroid.somee.com/api/media 
```

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

```shell
npm start
``` 

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

```shell
npm run build
```

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.
